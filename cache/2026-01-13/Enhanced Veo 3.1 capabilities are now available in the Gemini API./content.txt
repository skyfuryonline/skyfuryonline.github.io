Enhanced Veo 3.1 capabilities are now available in the Gemini API.
Today, we are releasing
updates to Veo 3.1
in the
Gemini API
and
Google AI Studio
, giving developers greater creative control and production-ready quality.
Enhanced Ingredients to Video:
The updated model intelligently synthesizes your inputs to preserve character identity and background details, ensuring your characters and settings remain consistent across videos.
Native Vertical Format Videos for Ingredients to Video (Portrait Mode):
Generate social-ready 9:16 videos directly. Designed for mobile-first applications, this mode delivers faster results and optimized composition by generating full-frame vertical video rather than cropping from landscape.
New 4K and Improved 1080p definition:
Unlock professional fidelity directly within your workflow. Using state-of-the-art enhancement techniques, the model now outputs clearer, crisp 1080p and creates stunning 4K videos suitable for the big screen.
These capabilities, along with our SynthID digital watermark, are available today in the
Gemini API
and
Vertex AI
for enterprises. See this in action via the Google AI Studio
demo app
.
