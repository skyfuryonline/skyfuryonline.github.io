There’s a specific kind of magic in getting a generative AI model to do exactly what you want. You tweak the prompt, you adjust the context, and suddenly - it clicks. But for many developers, that moment of success is followed by a slightly less magical question:
Okay, now how do I turn this into a real app without racking up a massive bill?
We want to fix that disconnect. The distance between a great idea in a chat window and an online application should be as short as possible.
That’s why we’ve just integrated Google Developer Program (GDP) premium benefits directly into
Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra
subscriptions at no extra cost. This includes $10 per month in Google Cloud credits for Google AI Pro subscribers and $100 per month for Google AI Ultra subscribers.
The fuel to build and deploy
Previously, a GDP premium subscription gave you access to our most capable models, like Gemini 3 Pro. That’s great for prototyping. But moving to production usually meant navigating a separate setup for Google Cloud billing. It was a speed bump in what should be a smooth ride.
By integrating GDP premium in Google AI Pro and Google AI Ultra, you get the resources you need to ship what you build, through Google Cloud credits. This means you can experiment with developer tools without hitting a wall the moment you want to go live.
Your new end-to-end journey
Here is what this looks like in practice. We’re connecting the dots to create a seamless workflow from idea to "Hello, World."
Prototype and build:
You can start by refining your prompts in Google AI Studio, dive into our new agentic IDE, Google Antigravity, or tap our open-source AI agent in the terminal with Gemini CLI.
Deploy and scale:
Once your application is running as intended, you don’t need to stop. You can use your monthly Google Cloud credits to push that code to production—whether that’s via Vertex AI or Cloud Run. Additionally, you can use the credits towards Gemini API to get more mileage interacting with agents via AI Studio or Vertex AI.
Get started today
If you‘re an active Google AI Pro or Google AI Ultra subscriber, visit
Google Developer Program
to activate your new benefits and explore the program’s content, communities and forums
Now, go build something fun.
