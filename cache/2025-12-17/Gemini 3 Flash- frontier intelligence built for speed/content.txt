Today, we're expanding the Gemini 3 model family with the release of Gemini 3 Flash, which offers frontier intelligence built for speed at a fraction of the cost. With this release, we’re making Gemini 3’s next-generation intelligence accessible to everyone across Google products.
Last month, we kicked off Gemini 3 with
Gemini 3 Pro
and
Gemini 3 Deep Think
mode, and the response has been incredible. Since launch day, we have been processing over 1T tokens per day on our API. We’ve seen you use Gemini 3 to
vibe code simulations
to learn about complex topics, build and design
interactive games
and understand all types of
multimodal content
.
With Gemini 3, we introduced frontier performance across complex reasoning,
multimodal and vision understanding
and agentic and vibe coding tasks. Gemini 3 Flash retains this foundation, combining Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost. It not only enables everyday tasks with improved reasoning, but also is our most impressive model for agentic workflows.
Starting today, Gemini 3 Flash is rolling out to millions of people globally:
For developers in the Gemini API in
Google AI Studio
,
Gemini CLI
and our new agentic development platform
Google Antigravity
For everyone via the
Gemini app
and in
AI Mode in Search
For enterprises in
Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise
Gemini 3 Flash: frontier intelligence at scale
Gemini 3 Flash demonstrates that speed and scale don’t have to come at the cost of intelligence. It delivers frontier performance on PhD-level reasoning and knowledge benchmarks like GPQA Diamond (90.4%) and Humanity’s Last Exam (33.7% without tools), rivaling larger frontier models, and significantly outperforming even the best 2.5 model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, across a number of benchmarks. It also reaches state-of-the-art performance with an impressive score of 81.2% on MMMU Pro, comparable to Gemini 3 Pro.
In addition to its frontier-level reasoning and multimodal capabilities, Gemini 3 Flash was built to be highly efficient, pushing the Pareto frontier of quality vs. cost and speed. When processing at the highest thinking level, Gemini 3 Flash is able to modulate how much it thinks. It may think longer for more complex use cases, but it also uses 30% fewer tokens on average than 2.5 Pro, as measured on typical traffic, to accurately complete everyday tasks with higher performance.
Gemini 3 Flash pushes the Pareto frontier on performance vs. cost and speed.
Gemini 3 Flash’s strength lies in its raw speed, building on the Flash series that developers and consumers already love. It outperforms 2.5 Pro while being 3x faster (based on
Artificial Analysis
benchmarking) at a fraction of the cost. Gemini 3 Flash is priced at $0.50/1M input tokens and $3/1M output tokens (audio input remains at $1/1M input tokens).

For developers: intelligence that keeps up
Gemini 3 Flash is made for iterative development, offering Gemini 3’s Pro-grade coding performance with low latency — it’s able to reason and solve tasks quickly in high-frequency workflows. On SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark for evaluating coding agent capabilities, Gemini 3 Flash achieves a score of 78%, outperforming not only the 2.5 series, but also Gemini 3 Pro. It strikes an ideal balance for agentic coding, production-ready systems and responsive interactive applications.

Gemini 3 Flash in Google Antigravity works quickly to update production-ready applications.
Gemini 3 Flash’s strong performance in reasoning, tool use and multimodal capabilities is ideal for developers looking to do more complex video analysis, data extraction and visual Q&A, which means it can enable more intelligent applications — like in-game assistants or A/B test experiments — that demand both quick answers and deep reasoning.

For everyone: Gemini 3 Flash is rolling out globally
Gemini 3 Flash is now the default model in the Gemini app, replacing 2.5 Flash. That means all of our Gemini users globally will get access to the Gemini 3 experience at no cost, giving their everyday tasks a major upgrade.
Because of Gemini 3 Flash’s incredible multimodal reasoning capabilities, you can use it to help you see, hear and understand any type of information faster. For example, you can ask Gemini to understand your videos and images and turn that content into a helpful and actionable plan in just a few seconds.
