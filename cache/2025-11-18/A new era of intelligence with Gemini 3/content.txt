Responsible development
A note from Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai:
Nearly two years ago we kicked off the Gemini era, one of our biggest scientific and product endeavors ever undertaken as a company. Since then, it’s been incredible to see how much people love it. AI Overviews now have 2 billion users every month. The Gemini app surpasses 650 million users per month, more than 70% of our Cloud customers use our AI, 13 million developers have built with our generative models, and that is just a snippet of the impact we’re seeing.
And we’re able to get advanced capabilities to the world faster than ever, thanks to our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation — from our leading infrastructure to our world-class research and models and tooling, to products that reach billions of people around the world.
Every generation of Gemini has built on the last, enabling you to do more. Gemini 1’s breakthroughs in
native multimodality
and
long context window
expanded the kinds of information that could be processed — and how much of it. Gemini 2 laid the foundation for
agentic capabilities
and pushed the frontiers on
reasoning and thinking
, helping with more complex tasks and ideas, leading to Gemini 2.5 Pro topping LMArena for over six months.
And now we’re introducing Gemini 3, our most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life.
It’s state-of-the-art in reasoning, built to grasp depth and nuance — whether it’s perceiving the subtle clues in a creative idea, or peeling apart the overlapping layers of a difficult problem. Gemini 3 is also much better at figuring out the context and intent behind your request, so you get what you need with less prompting. It’s amazing to think that in just two years, AI has evolved from simply reading text and images to reading the room.
And starting today, we’re shipping Gemini at the scale of Google. That includes Gemini 3 in
AI Mode in Search
with more complex reasoning and new dynamic experiences. This is the first time we are shipping Gemini in Search on day one. Gemini 3 is also coming today to the
Gemini app
, to developers in
AI Studio
and
Vertex AI
, and in our new agentic development platform,
Google Antigravity
— more below.
Like the generations before it, Gemini 3 is once again advancing the state of the art. In this new chapter, we’ll continue to push the frontiers of intelligence, agents, and personalization to make AI truly helpful for everyone.
We hope you like Gemini 3, we'll keep improving it, and look forward to seeing what you build with it. Much more to come!

Gemini 3 helps you learn, build and plan anything
Learn anything
Gemini was built from the start to seamlessly synthesize information about any topic across multiple modalities, including text, images, video, audio and code. Gemini 3 pushes the frontier of multimodal reasoning to help you learn in ways that make sense for you by combining its state-of-the-art reasoning, vision and spatial understanding, leading multilingual performance, and 1 million-token context window.
For example, if you want to learn how to cook in your family tradition, Gemini 3 can decipher and translate handwritten recipes in different languages into a shareable family cookbook. Or if you want to learn about a new topic, you can give it academic papers, long video lectures or tutorials and it can generate code for interactive flashcards, visualizations or other formats that will help you master the material. It can even analyze videos of your pickleball match, identify areas where you can improve and generate a training plan for overall form improvements.

Introducing a new agent-first development experience
As model intelligence accelerates with Gemini 3, we have the opportunity to reimagine the entire developer experience. Today we’re releasing
Google Antigravity
, our new agentic development platform that enables developers to operate at a higher, task-oriented level.
Using Gemini 3’s advanced reasoning, tool use and agentic coding capabilities, Google Antigravity transforms AI assistance from a tool in a developer’s toolkit into an active partner. While the core of Google Antigravity is a familiar AI IDE experience, its agents have been elevated to a dedicated surface and given direct access to the editor, terminal and browser. Now, agents can autonomously plan and execute complex, end-to-end software tasks simultaneously on your behalf while validating their own code.
In addition to Gemini 3 Pro, Google Antigravity also comes tightly coupled with our latest Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model for browser control and our top-rated image editing model Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Image).
00:00
Google Antigravity uses Gemini 3 to drive an end-to-end agentic workflow for a flight tracker app. The agent independently plans, codes the application and validates its execution through browser-based computer use.
Plan anything
Since introducing the agentic era with Gemini 2, we’ve made a lot of progress, not only advancing Gemini’s coding agent abilities, but also improving its ability to reliably plan ahead over longer horizons. Gemini 3 demonstrates this by topping the leaderboard on
Vending-Bench 2
, which tests longer horizon planning by managing a simulated vending machine business. Gemini 3 Pro maintains consistent tool usage and decision-making for a full simulated year of operation, driving higher returns without drifting off task.
Gemini 3 Pro demonstrates better long-horizon planning to generate significantly higher returns compared to other frontier models.
This means Gemini 3 can better help you get things done in everyday life. By combining deeper reasoning with improved, more consistent tool use, Gemini 3 can take action on your behalf by navigating more complex, multi-step workflows from start to finish — like booking local services or organizing your inbox — all while under your control and guidance.
Google AI Ultra subscribers can try these agentic capabilities in the Gemini app with
Gemini Agent
today. We’ve learned a lot improving Gemini’s agentic capabilities, and we’re excited to see how you use it as we expand to more Google products soon.
Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can
download it
and watch it with your favorite video player!
Gemini Agent
can help you organize your Gmail inbox. Try it now in the
Gemini app for Google AI Ultra subscribers
