For 16 years, the Google PhD Fellowship Program has supported exceptional graduate students pioneering research in computer science and related fields, with the goal of supporting the next generation of scientists focused on critical foundational science.
Today, we are announcing the recipients of the 2025 Google PhD Fellowship Program. Google.org is providing over $10 million to support 255 PhD students across 35 countries and 12 research domains, committing to a generation of researchers who understand that accelerating scientific discovery is vital to solving the world’s toughest challenges. See the complete list of
Google PhD Fellowship recipients for 2025
.
We equip our fellows with funding, dedicated support from a Google Mentor, and connections to a broad research community, all of which enable long-term partnerships that foster innovation across the scientific continuum.
Since the program's inception, we have supported over 950 students globally, representing 44 countries and 227 institutions. This year, we have expanded our reach to countries in Latin America and the Middle East, alongside eight existing regions, with the aim to strengthen and support research ecosystems around the world.
Here’s a look at past and present fellows who are shaping the future of the technology landscape:
Support from the PhD Fellowship Program enables researchers to focus on ambitious, high-impact work. Fellows have gone on to achieve innovative technological advancements and apply their research to address real societal challenges.
The PhD Fellowship Program is designed to connect students to the broader research community and unlock new opportunities to amplify their research.
A key component to the Fellowships Program is the hands-on mentorship from Google researchers. The program enables long-term partnerships that foster innovation across the scientific continuum.
With its global reach, the PhD Fellowship Program aims to support research communities around the world and foster collaborative ecosystems.
