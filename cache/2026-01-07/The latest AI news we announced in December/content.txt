For more than 20 years, we’ve invested in machine learning and AI research, tools and infrastructure to build products that make everyday life better for more people. Teams across Google are working on ways to unlock AI’s benefits in fields as wide-ranging as healthcare, crisis response and education. To keep you posted on our progress, we're doing a regular roundup of Google's most recent AI news.
Here’s a look back at some of our AI announcements from December.
December is usually a time for reflection, and looking ahead. That’s why this month we’ve been focused on taking frontier intelligence out of the lab and putting it into your hands in ways that actually matter for your day-to-day. Whether it’s the lightning speed of
Gemini 3 Flash
helping you tackle tasks in seconds, the new video
verification tools in the Gemini app
or the simple relief of having
GenTabs
tame your open tabs, these updates share a single goal: making technology adapt to you, not the other way around. And as we push these boundaries, we’re staying grounded in responsibility — launching new tools to help you verify AI content so you can explore this new frontier with confidence.
We released Gemini 3 Flash, featuring frontier intelligence built for speed
. Gemini 3 Flash brings frontier intelligence to virtually every corner of the Google ecosystem, combining the speed of our most advanced models with improved reasoning capabilities to help with everyday tasks, all while keeping costs significantly lower. It's rolling out as the default model
in the Gemini app
and
AI Mode in Search
so people everywhere can now experience the incredible reasoning of our frontier model, right in our consumer products. And we’ve scaled this rollout to a global community, including
developers building in the API
Antigravity, our new agentic development platform, and enterprise customers on
Vertex AI
.
We added new AI verification tools for videos in the Gemini app
. We’re bringing video verification capabilities directly to the Gemini app. People can now upload videos — up to 100 MB or 90 seconds — and simply ask if the content was generated or edited using Google AI. Gemini uses imperceptible SynthID watermarks to analyze both audio and visual tracks, pinpointing exactly which segments contain AI-generated elements.
We announced a new experiment to improve browsing and manage complex online tasks
. We’ve all felt the friction of juggling dozens of tabs to research a topic or plan a trip. Enter Disco, a new browsing experience from Google Labs designed to tame that complexity. Disco features GenTabs, an experiment that proactively synthesizes your open tabs and chat history to build custom, interactive web applications — transforming a scattered browser session into a streamlined tool for getting things done.
We upgraded Gemini audio models for powerful voice interactions
. The updated Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio is built to handle complex workflows and natural dialogue — meaning smoother conversations, higher accuracy and better responsiveness to instructions. It’s available now in AI Studio, Vertex AI, Gemini Live and, for the first time,
Search Live
. Plus, a new live speech translation beta in the
Google Translate app
brings live translation in 70+ languages directly to your headphones, preserving original intonation and pacing to unlock truly global communication.
We released a new Gemini Deep Research agent
. We brought a more powerful Gemini Deep Research to developers through the Interactions API. Developers can now embed advanced research capabilities — like navigating complex topics and synthesizing findings — directly into their own applications using a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio. We’ve also open-sourced our new DeepSearchQA benchmark, offering a transparent way to test just how comprehensive and effective research agents can be on web tasks. Plus, we shared how developers are already
building mobile-first solutions
to address real-world problems, from AI assistants for the visually impaired to tools fostering autonomy for people with cognitive disabilities.
We released a new way for shoppers in the U.S. to use our virtual try-on tool
. U.S. shoppers now have a more personalized way to find their next favorite outfit with our updated virtual try-on tool. Instead of needing a full-body photo, you can now upload a simple selfie and Nano Banana will generate a realistic, full-body digital version of you. Once you’ve selected your preferred studio-like image and clothing size, you can instantly see how you’d look in billions of products from our Shopping Graph.
We expanded Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro in Search
. We brought our most intelligent model, Gemini 3, to AI Mode in Google Search in nearly 120 countries and territories in English. Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers can visualize complex topics with Gemini 3 Pro by tapping “Thinking with 3 Pro” in the model drop-down in AI Mode. We also brought our generative imagery model, Nano Banana Pro, to AI Mode in more countries in English, starting with Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers. For those in the U.S., we also expanded access to these Pro models (no subscription required), with higher usage limits for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers.
We released the top YouTube trends of 2025 and first-ever personal Recap
. YouTube celebrated its 20th birthday by looking back at 2025. MrBeast was the top creator for the sixth year running, while Rosé and Bruno Mars’ track "APT." became the fastest KPop video to hit one billion views. To mark the occasion, YouTube is launching its
first-ever Recap
so you can see a personalized summary of your year.
We added new ways for you to personalize, create and share your Google Photos Recap
. Google Photos Recap has returned to help you celebrate your favorite moments from 2025, now with more features to make the experience truly yours. We’ve added new controls that let you hide specific people or photos, ensuring your trip down memory lane is exactly how you want it. Plus, you can now get creative with exclusive templates in CapCut and easily share your finished masterpiece directly to WhatsApp or your favorite social feeds.
We released Year in Search 2025
. 2025 delivered history-making headlines — from the first American Pope to the global obsession with "KPop Demon Hunters" — but the quietest revolution happened right at our fingertips. Thanks to AI, this was the year we saw a massive shift toward natural, conversational questions with a surge in queries like “How do I…” and “What’s the deal with…” as AI helped technology finally catch up to the way we think.
