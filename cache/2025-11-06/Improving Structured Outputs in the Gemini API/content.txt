Today, we're announcing enhancements to
Structured Outputs in the Gemini API
, with expanded support for JSON Schema and better adherence to property ordering in the output.
Structured Outputs enable AI models to generate responses that guarantee adherence to a specific schema, which is important for tasks like data extraction and database population. They are also important for agent communication: one agent’s output becomes another’s formatted input, enabling complex multi-agent systems to collaborate without translation layers.
Expanded JSON Schema support
We’ve now added
support for JSON Schema
to all actively supported Gemini models. This enables libraries like
Pydantic
(Python) or
Zod
(JavaScript/TypeScript) to work out-of-the-box with the Gemini API. It builds upon the current support for the Gemini API’s
Schema
object that is based on
OpenAPI 3.0
for Structured Outputs and Function Calling.
This update also adds support for frequently requested JSON Schema keywords, including:
anyOf for conditional structures (Unions)
$ref for recursive schemas
minimum and maximum for numeric constraints
additionalProperties and type: 'null'
prefixItems for tuple-like arrays
Implicit property ordering
One of the important updates we have made is that the API now preserves the same order as the ordering of keys in the schema. This is supported for all Gemini 2.5 models and beyond and also applies to our
OpenAI compatibility API
. You can see this in action in this content moderation example using Pydantic:
from
google
import
genai
from
pydantic
import
BaseModel, Field
from
typing
import
Union
,
Literal
class
SpamDetails
(
BaseModel
):
"""Details for content classified as spam."""
reason:
str
= Field(description=
"The reason why the content is considered spam."
)
    spam_type:
Literal
[
"phishing"
,
"scam"
,
"unsolicited promotion"
,
"other"
] = Field(description=
"The type of spam."
)
class
NotSpamDetails
(
BaseModel
):
"""Details for content classified as not spam."""
summary:
str
= Field(description=
"A brief summary of the content."
)
    is_safe:
bool
= Field(description=
"Whether the content is safe for all audiences."
)
class
ModerationResult
(
BaseModel
):
"""The result of content moderation."""
decision:
Union
[SpamDetails, NotSpamDetails]

client = genai.Client()

prompt =
"""
Please moderate the following content and provide a decision.
Content: 'Congratulations! You've won a free cruise to the Bahamas. Click here to claim your prize: www.definitely-not-a-scam.com'
"""
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=
"gemini-2.5-flash"
,
    contents=prompt,
    config={
"response_mime_type"
:
"application/json"
,
"response_json_schema"
: ModerationResult.model_json_schema(),
    },
)

recipe = ModerationResult.model_validate_json(response.text)
print
(recipe)
Structured Outputs in the real world
Structured Outputs is one of the most frequently used tools by developers building real-world AI applications. Here are some examples of how some of our early access partners have used the tool to improve their workflows:
For
Agentic Users
, a platform for autonomous agents for the web, the most significant impact and cost savings from using Structured Outputs has been in data extraction. They rely on Pydantic + responseJsonSchema for use cases like extracting attributes related to brand guidelines from image and text examples provided by our users, and parametersJsonSchema for all function declarations.
We are building AI agents for the agentic web, and our main goal is to build trust in AI agents for handling business operations. Being able to define precise schemas and trust the output is key to our production systems. Structured Outputs have reduced API calls by up to 6x in some workflows and completely eliminated the broken JSON responses that used to require extra validation checks.”

Alkimi AI
creates AI assistants for businesses and education institutions grounded in their knowledge. Using JSON Schema they are able to reliably pass data through a guaranteed schema within their multi-stage LLM pipeline. This helps them efficiently automate the configuration of their AI assistants — “Agent Wizard” — for each of their partners.
“For us, Structured Outputs are all about reliability, speed and cost efficiency. By forcing the LLM to provide a predictable, machine-readable format, we can build more robust features faster, reduce errors, and use cheaper models for tasks that would otherwise require more expensive ones.”
