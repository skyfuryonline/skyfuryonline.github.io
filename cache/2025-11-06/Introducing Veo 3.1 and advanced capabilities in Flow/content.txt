Five months ago, we introduced
Flow
, our AI filmmaking tool powered by
Veo
, and have been inspired by the creativity it has sparked with over 275 million videos generated in Flow
1
. We're always listening to your feedback, and we've heard that you want more artistic control within Flow, with increased support for audio across all features.
Today, we’re introducing new and enhanced creative capabilities to edit your clips, giving you more granular control over your final scene. For the first time, we’re also bringing audio to existing capabilities like “Ingredients to Video,” “Frames to Video” and “Extend.”
We’re also introducing Veo 3.1, which brings richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism that captures true-to-life textures. Veo 3.1 is
state-of-the-art
and builds on Veo 3, with stronger prompt adherence and improved audiovisual quality when turning images into videos.

Refine your narrative with audio and more control
With Veo 3.1, we’re bringing audio to existing capabilities to help you craft the perfect scene. These features are experimental and actively improving, and we’re excited to see what you create as we iterate based on your feedback.
Now, with rich, generated audio, you can:
Craft the look of your scene.
With "Ingredients to Video," you can use multiple reference images to control the characters, objects and style. Flow uses your ingredients to create a final scene that looks just as you envisioned.
00:00
Control the shot from start to finish.
Provide a starting and ending image with “Frames to Video,” and Flow will generate a seamless video that bridges the two, perfect for artful and epic transitions.
00:00
Create longer, seamless shots.
With "Extend," you can create longer videos, even lasting for a minute or more, that connect to and continue the action from your original clip. Each video is generated based on the final second of your previous clip, making it most useful for creating a longer establishing shot.
00:00
Edit your ingredients and videos with more precision
Great ideas can strike at any point in the creative process. For moments when the first take isn't the final one, we're introducing new editing capabilities directly within Flow to help you reimagine and perfect your scenes.
Add new elements to any scene.
With “Insert,” introduce anything you can imagine, from realistic details to fantastical creatures. Flow now handles complex details like shadows and scene lighting, making the addition look natural.
Remove unwanted objects or characters seamlessly.
Soon, you’ll be able to take anything out of a scene, and Flow will reconstruct the background and surroundings, making it look as though the object was never there.
