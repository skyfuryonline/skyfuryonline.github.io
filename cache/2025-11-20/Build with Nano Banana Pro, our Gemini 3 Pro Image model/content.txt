Today, we’re releasing
Nano Banana Pro
(Gemini 3 Pro Image), a higher-fidelity model built on
Gemini 3 Pro
for developers to access studio-quality image generation. This follows our release of
Nano Banana
(Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) just a few months ago. Since then, we’ve loved seeing the community put its
key features
to work — from character consistency to
photo restoration
, and even using its capabilities to make
local edits
in an infinite canvas.
This state-of-the-art image generation and editing model is starting to roll out in paid preview to build a new wave of intelligent, multimodal applications with the
Gemini API
in
Google AI Studio
and
Vertex AI
for enterprises. This model unlocks high-fidelity images with higher accuracy in text rendering and robust world knowledge, supercharged by the model's ability to use grounding with Google Search to retrieve data based on the user's prompt.
Gemini 3 Pro Image excels on Text to Image AI benchmarks.
We are also expanding the reach of Gemini 3 Pro Image across the developer ecosystem. In
Google Antigravity
— our new agentic development platform — coding agents can now directly leverage these image generation capabilities to generate detailed UI mockups for user review or even new visual assets before implementing in code. Additionally, leading creative platforms are integrating the model, including Adobe and Figma.
High fidelity and controls
If you’re building advanced tools that require precision, Gemini 3 Pro Image gives you control over the physics (lighting, camera, focus, color grading) and composition of the image to ensure professional-quality outputs.

With 2K and 4k resolution available, you can ensure outputs meet resolution standards required for professional production. Effortlessly create cohesive advertisements by combining diverse elements such as product images, logos, and references. Achieve consistent resemblance for up to five individuals, integrate six high-fidelity shots, or blend as many as fourteen standard inputs into a single, polished ad. Try our
demo app
that allows you to pair logos with products to create your own mockup designs.

download it
and watch it with your favorite video player!

Improved text rendering and localization
Gemini 3 Pro Image offers a significant leap forward from 2.5 Flash Image, transforming abstract image generation into functional assets. It excels in handling logic and language, and delivers state-of-the-art text rendering, producing clear, accurate text integrated in your images.

It's also an ideal solution for developing marketing collateral, educational content and numerous other applications. Try the model’s capabilities in our
comic book generator app
in Google AI Studio, where you can create original multi-page comic books featuring you and a friend, complete with advanced text rendering and stylization.

With Gemini 3 Pro Image, we’ve removed the barrier between image generation and localization logic. This advanced model grasps the semantic context of an image, enabling effortless language changes on elements like menus, signs, or documents utilizing image-to-image generation keeping original artistic style or layout.

Access to the world’s knowledge
Gemini 3 Pro Image connects a vast knowledge base to produce more factual assets over previous image generation models. Additionally, when enabled, grounding with Google Search connects the model to real-time web content for data-driven outputs. This is particularly valuable for applications requiring precise representations, such as biological diagrams or historical maps. Try this for yourself with our
demo app
where you can dynamically create infographics on any topic tailored to your audience.

This new model release incorporates much of the input you have already shared with us, but we aren’t stopping here. To ensure clear provenance in AI-generated media, we have integrated
SynthID digital watermarks
directly into every image created or edited with Gemini 3 Pro Image to denote its AI-generated or edited origin.
Start by exploring our
collection of apps
that use Gemini 3 Pro Image to spark your imagination and see what’s possible. Once you’re inspired, remix these demo apps or integrate the model directly into your own projects via the
Gemini API
in
Google AI Studio
and
Vertex AI
for enterprise use. For technical details along the way, check out the
